PHP Reverse Shell:

The PHP Reverse Shell is a simple script that provides a reverse shell functionality in PHP. 
A reverse shell allows an attacker to gain remote access to a target system by connecting back to a listening shell on the attacker's machine. 

Features

- Simple and lightweight PHP script for reverse shell functionality.
- I used a simple loop, making the code easier to follow.
- I used a fixed buffer size (2048 bytes) for reading and writing data, as it's sufficient for most reverse shell interactions.
